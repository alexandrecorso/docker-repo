# Bird

## Build

You need to provide a configuration file named `bird.conf`, the best way is to provide the directory where you store your configuration.

```
docker build . -t acorso/bird
```

## Run

You need to provide a configuration file named `bird.conf`, the best way is to provide the directory where you store your configuration.

```
docker run -d -p 179:179 --name my_bird \
--privileged --restart=always \
acorso/bird
```

You can check the status
```
> $ docker exec -it my_bird birdc show status

***Tips***
I often link my bird socket to the bird-exporter (prometheus), to do so, I attach a directory to share the socket.

```
docker run -d -p 179:179 --name my_bird \
--privileged --restart=always \
-v ./my_directory:/etc/bird:rw \
-v ./shared_socket:/var/run:rw \
acorso/bird
```


## Example

```
> $ docker run -d -p 179:179 --name my_bird \
--privileged --restart=always \
-v ~/project/bird/conf:/etc/bird:rw \
acorso/bird
